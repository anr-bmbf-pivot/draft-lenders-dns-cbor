      "body": "During the [mailing list discussions of `-03`](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cbor/JOHCCBOzC46PrSq-61MMev--mpU/), @chrysn proposed to represent names as their components instead of `tstr`, similar to how it is done in [draft-ietf-core-href](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-href/):\r\n\r\n>     host-name   = (*text) ; lowercase, NFC labels\r\n>\r\n>   That is, rather than expressing some.hostname.example.com as `\"some.hostname.example.com\"`, it goes for `\"some\",  \"hostname\", \"example\", \"com\"`\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages to that representation:\r\n\r\n- If not put in their own array, but just verbatim into the arrays already used in the spec, we safe the list specifier, i.e, one byte at least\r\n- Dots (\".\") can be expressed as part of a name component without extra encoding (I don't think that is legal in DNS domain names; @chrysn says they can occur in DNS-SD service names though)\r\n- It would be more in line with how DNS encodes names (delimiter identifies the length of the following name component)\r\n   - This would have the additional advantage that we could use a DNS-like name compression (i.e. an int to refer to an offset in the CBOR binary). The only thing we need to do to make names also encodeable as `uint`s is to swap ttl in RR. This way, the first int in a CBOR array that potentially could contain names always would be identifiable as the name (questions always contain a name, so the first `uint` would just be the name).\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage we found so far is that there is no straightforward way to use the value or inverted references for names with this... But maybe, if we have DNS-like name compression, this wouldn't be needed anyways.",

If so, is the 1 in `;packed=1`\r\n> intended to serve as an extension point that dispatches the values of\r\n> the table?\r\n\r\nI really like this idea! However, some details need to be ironed out as this could go several (somewhat disjunct) routes:\r\n1. Are these extension points pre-defined tables?\r\n2. Do we use CRIs/URIs to identify and find tables (see e.g. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-amsuess-cbor-packed-by-reference/)?\r\n3. Should the extension point be used in a similar manner as SCHC rule IDs, i.e., identify some pre-shared tables?\r\n\r\n1. and 3. don't necessarily contradict each other, as we could reserve number ranges for either pre-defined tables or pre-shared tables? 2. could also be integrated, e.g. with a dedicated number.",
